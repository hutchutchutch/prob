# Task ID: 20
# Title: Create Drift Detection Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build a LangGraph-based drift detection system to identify inconsistencies between documents and the current project state.
# Details:
Implement file change monitoring. Create LangGraph flow for loading and analyzing all documents. Develop cross-referencing logic for inconsistency detection. Implement naming mismatch identification. Create feature discrepancy detection. Build technical conflict identification. Generate comprehensive drift reports. Example: 'const detectDrift = async (projectFiles, currentState) => { const langGraph = new LangGraph(); const analysis = await langGraph.analyzeDocuments(projectFiles); return compareWithCurrentState(analysis, currentState); };'

# Test Strategy:
Test drift detection with various types of changes. Verify accuracy of inconsistency identification. Test performance with large projects. Ensure drift reports are clear and actionable.
