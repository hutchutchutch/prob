# Task ID: 2
# Title: Develop Local SQLite Storage System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a complete offline storage system using SQLite to mirror all Supabase tables and manage local data operations.
# Details:
Use Tauri's SQLite plugin to set up local database. Mirror all Supabase tables in SQLite. Implement CRUD operations for all entities. Create functions for database connection management, sync conflict resolution, backup and recovery, and queue-based synchronization. Example: 'async function createLocalUser(user: User): Promise<void> { await db.execute('INSERT INTO users (id, email, ...) VALUES (?, ?, ...)', [user.id, user.email, ...]); }'

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each CRUD operation. Test sync mechanisms with mock online/offline scenarios. Verify data integrity after sync operations. Test backup and recovery processes.
