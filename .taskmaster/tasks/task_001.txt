# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement Complete Database Schema
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the full database schema as specified in the product vision, including all tables, relationships, and specialized tables for version control and performance optimization.
# Details:
Create the following tables: users, workspaces, projects, core_problems, personas, pain_points, solutions, user_stories, documents, canvas_states, react_flow_states, solution_pain_point_mappings, persona_pain_points, canvas_events, state_snapshots, lock_management, sync_queue, recent_flows_cache, demo_templates. Ensure proper relationships and constraints are set up. Use SQL to create tables, e.g., 'CREATE TABLE users (id UUID PRIMARY KEY, email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL, ...);'

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for each table creation, relationship, and constraint. Use a test database to verify schema integrity. Test edge cases like unique constraints and foreign key relationships.
