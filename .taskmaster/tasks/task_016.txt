# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Event Sourcing System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive version control system with event logging and state management.
# Details:
Implement event logging for all state changes. Capture before/after states for each event. Build efficient state diff calculator. Implement event categorization and metadata tracking. Create event batching for performance. Example: 'const logEvent = async (type, data, beforeState, afterState) => { const event = { type, data, beforeState, afterState, user: getCurrentUser(), timestamp: Date.now() }; await storeEvent(event); updateCurrentState(afterState); };'

# Test Strategy:
Test event logging for various actions. Verify correct before/after state capture. Test diff calculation accuracy. Ensure event batching improves performance without losing data integrity.
