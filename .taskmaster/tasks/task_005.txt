# Task ID: 5
# Title: Polish Welcome Screen and Authentication
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the authentication experience with social login options, smooth transitions, and first-time user onboarding.
# Details:
Integrate the demo canvas as an animated background. Implement social login (Google, GitHub) using Supabase Auth. Create smooth post-auth transitions using React Router and animation libraries. Add loading states and error handling. Develop a first-time user onboarding flow with step-by-step guidance. Example: 'const { user, signIn } = useSupabaseAuth(); const handleGoogleLogin = async () => { await signIn({ provider: 'google' }); };'

# Test Strategy:
Test login flows for all providers. Verify error states and loading indicators. Ensure smooth transitions between authentication states. Test onboarding flow completion and state persistence.
