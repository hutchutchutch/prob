# Title: Implement User Story Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Complete the user story creation system, including generation, structure, and editing capabilities.
# Details:
Finish generate-user-stories Edge Function. Implement story structure (As a/I want/So that). Add acceptance criteria generation. Create inline editing capabilities for stories. Build story validation system. Add drag-to-reorder functionality. Example: 'const UserStory = ({ story, onEdit }) => { return (<div className="user-story"> <p>{story.asA} {story.iWant} {story.soThat}</p> <AcceptanceCriteria criteria={story.acceptanceCriteria} /> <EditButton onClick={() => onEdit(story)} /> </div>); };'

# Test Strategy:
Test user story generation for various solutions. Verify correct story structure and relevance. Test inline editing and validation. Ensure drag-and-drop reordering works smoothly.
