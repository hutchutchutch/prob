# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Solution Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Complete the solution discovery system, including generation, mapping to pain points, and visualization.
# Details:
Finish generate-solutions Edge Function. Implement pain point to solution mapping. Add solution complexity scoring and type categorization. Build position-based layout for solutions. Create solution node visualizations. Example: 'const generateSolutions = async (painPoints) => { const solutions = await edgeFunction.generateSolutions(painPoints); return solutions.map(s => ({ ...s, complexity: calculateComplexity(s), type: categorizeSolution(s) })); };'

# Test Strategy:
Test solution generation for various pain points. Verify relevance and diversity of solutions. Test mapping accuracy between pain points and solutions. Ensure layout and visualizations work for different numbers of solutions.
