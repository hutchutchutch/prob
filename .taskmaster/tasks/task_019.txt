# Task ID: 19
# Title: Develop File System Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement project directory management with file system integration and real-time change tracking.
# Details:
Create project folders on document generation. Save all documents as markdown/SQL files. Implement file system watcher using Tauri API. Track file modifications in real-time. Create file backup system. Example: 'const watchProjectFiles = async (projectPath) => { const watcher = await fs.watch(projectPath, { recursive: true }); for await (const event of watcher) { handleFileChange(event); } };'

# Test Strategy:
Test file creation and modification for all document types. Verify real-time change detection. Test backup system for various scenarios. Ensure file system operations are efficient and don't block the main thread.
