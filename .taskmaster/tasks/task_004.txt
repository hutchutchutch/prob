# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create Demo Canvas Animation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop an impressive welcome screen demo with an animated canvas showcasing a sample transformation flow.
# Details:
Use React Flow to create a demo canvas. Implement a 30-second animation loop with breathing effects (scale 0.98-1.02), edge pulse animations, and node shimmer effects. Use CSS animations and React Spring for smooth transitions. Store demo template in the database. Example: 'const breathingAnimation = useSpring({ from: { scale: 1 }, to: { scale: 1.02 }, config: { duration: 1000 }, loop: { reverse: true } });'

# Test Strategy:
Visually inspect animation smoothness and timing. Test across different screen sizes and resolutions. Measure performance impact and optimize if necessary. Ensure demo loads quickly and runs efficiently.
