# Task ID: 23
# Title: Optimize Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 8, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Improve overall application performance, focusing on animations, canvas rendering, and data synchronization.
# Details:
Profile and optimize all animations. Implement node virtualization for large canvases. Optimize edge rendering algorithms. Add level-of-detail system for improved performance. Implement intelligent sync batching and delta sync. Example: 'const optimizeCanvasRendering = () => { const virtualizedNodes = useVirtualization(nodes); const optimizedEdges = useMemo(() => optimizeEdges(edges), [edges]); return <ReactFlow nodes={virtualizedNodes} edges={optimizedEdges} />; };'

# Test Strategy:
Conduct performance profiling for various user scenarios. Measure FPS for animations and canvas interactions. Test sync performance with large datasets. Verify memory usage stays within target (<500MB).
