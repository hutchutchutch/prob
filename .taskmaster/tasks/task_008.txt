# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Pain Point Discovery
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the pain point generation system with persona attribution, canvas layout transitions, and selection system.
# Details:
Develop generate-pain-points Edge Function. Implement persona attribution system. Create canvas layout transitions with slide/fade effects. Build selection system with blue ring highlights and connected element glow effects. Implement multi-select with Shift+click. Visualize pain severity. Example: 'const PainPointNode = ({ data, isSelected }) => { return (<div className={`pain-point ${isSelected ? 'selected' : ''}`}> <h3>{data.title}</h3> <p>Severity: {data.severity}</p> <p>Attributed to: {data.persona.name}</p> </div>); };'

# Test Strategy:
Test pain point generation for relevance and diversity. Verify correct persona attribution. Test selection system with keyboard and mouse interactions. Ensure smooth transitions and performance with many pain points.
