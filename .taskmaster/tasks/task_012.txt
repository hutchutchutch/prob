# Task ID: 12
# Title: Develop AI Focus Group System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the innovative focus group feature with AI-driven voting and discussion simulation.
# Details:
Create Facilitator AI agent using LangGraph. Implement parallel dot-voting system with persona-based logic. Create voting visualization on nodes. Add must-have feature discussions. Store all voting data in the database. Implement hover states showing voting breakdown. Example: 'const simulateFocusGroup = async (solutions) => { const facilitator = new FacilitatorAgent(); const votingResults = await facilitator.runVotingSession(solutions, personas); return processVotingResults(votingResults); };'

# Test Strategy:
Test focus group simulation with various solution sets. Verify persona-based voting logic. Test voting visualizations and hover states. Ensure consistent and realistic AI-driven discussions.
