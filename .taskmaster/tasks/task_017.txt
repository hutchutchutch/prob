# Task ID: 17
# Title: Create Timeline Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the time travel UI with event visualization and state reconstruction capabilities.
# Details:
Create VersionTimeline component at the bottom of the canvas. Implement event visualization with hover preview. Build state reconstruction engine. Add restore capabilities. Create filtering by event type. Implement smooth transitions during time travel. Example: 'const TimelineEvent = ({ event, onHover, onRestore }) => { return (<div className="timeline-event" onMouseEnter={() => onHover(event)} onClick={() => onRestore(event)}> <EventIcon type={event.type} /> <span>{formatTimestamp(event.timestamp)}</span> </div>); };'

# Test Strategy:
Test timeline rendering with various event types. Verify hover preview functionality. Test state reconstruction and restoration for different points in time. Ensure smooth animations during time travel.
